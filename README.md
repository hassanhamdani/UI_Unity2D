# UI_Unity2D

This is a simple Unity project to figure out how to work with the Button components within Unity. It involves adding scripts to the button components in order to tell Unity what you what to do through the onClick() function. 
An error I was facing was that even after adding the script to the onClick() setting inside the Button component, I was unable to access the function inside the script. The way to fix this was to create an empty gameObject that hosts just the script, and then adding that gameObject to the onClick() function instead.
